Examples:

- Which therapy should I choose?
- What therapy is best for my child?
- Can you recommend a therapy?
- I'm confused about therapies.
- Tell me about therapies.
- Therapy library.
- Help me choose a therapy.

Also do not trigger when a different specific therapy has been identified, such as:
- Neurofeedback

- Feldenkrais Method
- Vision Therapy
- Lynn Valley Optometry
- Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP)
- Tomatis Method
- Integrated Listening Therapy
- Nemechek Protocol
- Cellular Hydration
- Ayurveda
- Naturopathy
- Access Consciousness
- Jill Stowell Learning Centers

Fallback Rule:

If the Understanding Node is not confident that the specific therapy is MNRI:
- If the user's intent is related to therapies in general, display the Therapy Library CTA (data/cta/therapies/general.md).
- Otherwise, do not display any therapy CTA.
